      <h2>Company History</h2>
      <h3>Early History</h3>
      <p>The tradition of hauling valuable cargo from one place to another can be traced deep in the Cassens bloodline. When Napoleon’s army was defeated in the unsuccessful invasion of Russia in 1812, German farmers such as 20-year-old Hans H. Wilkening were employed by the French government to help carry wounded soldiers across Germany and back to France.</p>
      <img src="./cass-photo1.jpg" alt=""> <br>
      <p>In 1918, when Hans H. Wilkening’s grandson, George Cassens, had his first opportunity to get involved with automobiles, the 38-year-old jumped at the chance and became a sub-dealer for John Brandes Garage in Marine, Illinois, selling a few of the new Reo automobiles to friends around Edwardsville, Hamel, and Worden.</p> <br>
      <p>In 1920, George accepted the dealership for Hudson’s Essex line of automobiles. His only start-up expense was a garage to work out of. In the 1920’s, automobiles were still a luxury and such a new commodity on the American landscape that most people didn’t know how to drive automobiles. George had to not only sell the automobiles, he had to teach the people how to drive. There were no oiled, gravel, or blacktop roads, just dirt. If you wanted to sell a car, you had to make a personal call to people’s homes, or go out in the field where they worked and demonstrate the cars. In 1924, George started taking his teenage sons Arnold and Albert on sales calls.</p> <br>
      <p>In 1929, George sold 165 new Hudson-Essex automobiles. Because of the Stock Market Crash and the resulting depression, he only sold 3 in 1931.</p> <br>
      <p>To help get through the Depression, George and his sons entered the trucking business by hauling milk for the Pevely Dairy. In 1931-1932, they expanded their hauling to include corn, apples and potatoes.</p> <br>
      <p>Even though auto sales were slow, there was enough demand to warrant having some new cars on hand in the Hamel showroom.</p> <br>
      <p>In 1931, the automobile dealers had to get their own cars from the manufactures. Most automobiles were shipped from the assembly plants via the railroads and the dealers would get the automobiles from the railroads. This worked, but was very expensive for the dealers. George and his sons determined that they could save both time and money by having the automobiles shipped directly to them via trucks. Arnold and Albert rode a bus from Edwardsville to Detroit for $6, each carrying a tow bar borrowed from a garage. When they got to Detroit, they slung the tow bars over their shoulders and caught the street car. For a nickel, they rode from the Statler Hotel way out to the Hudson plant on the corner of East Jefferson and Connors Avenue. They then walked about a half mile along Connors to Kercheval and stopped at John Fleming’s filling station. They left the tow bars there and returned to the Hudson plant driveway and waited on a bench for their cars to come out. Then they drove the cars to John Fleming’s and hooked them up.
      </p> <br>
      <p>On the first trip, the tow bars they had carried from Edwardsville did not fit. They walked back to the Hudson plant and cashed a check so they could buy two other tow bars that did fit. They were able to head back to Edwardsville with the four new Hudson-Essex cars.</p> <br>
      <p>In the winter of 1932, Dodge-Plymouth was looking for new Dodge dealers in the Edwardsville area. The Dodge representative heard about the Cassens and thought they might be interested. When the representative arrived at the house to talk, he wasn’t let in. The Lindbergh baby had been kidnapped earlier that year and George’s wife, Louise, was afraid this stranger might be a kidnapper and wouldn’t let him in the house. After George straightened things out, they met with him a couple of times and decided to take the new dealership. The new Dodge-Plymouth agency opened in Edwardsville on June 22, 1933. It moved to a new location in 1996, but it is still in operation today.</p> <br>
      <p>George never lost his zest for over-the-road hauling. Soon after opening the Dodge-Plymouth agency, he ordered a new four-car transport trailer to bring his cars back from Detroit. The outfit consisted of a two-ton Dodge truck and a four-car auto trailer. The rig, built in September of 1933 was affectionately known as “Old No. 1” and cost only $1,850.</p> <br>
      <p>George’s son, Albert, spent a week in Detroit getting the first load ready. He bought bed sheets for $1 apiece and put them around the windshields to protect the glass from low-hanging limbs. This was done for about a year until concrete roads became more prevalent.</p> <br>
